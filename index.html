    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I believe in training AI to assist humans, not to replace them. This
      perspective ensures that AI development supports human skills enhancement
      and job creation, aligning technological progress with the betterment of
      society.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>ASHA (Advanced Sensing and Hand-Movement Aid)</h3></li>
      <p>Aug 2023 - Sep 2023</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ASHA, derived from the Sanskrit word meaning 'hope,' stands for
          Advanced Sensing and Hand-Movement Aid, a post-stroke rehabilitation
          device.
        </li>
        <li>
          The components include an MPU6050 Accelerometer & Gyroscope Module, a
          DFPlayer Mini, and a Speaker, all interfaced with an Arduino Uno and
          mounted on a simple glove.
        </li>
        <li>
          This setup gathers analog data through the MPU6050 module, which is
          transmitted to the Arduino Uno.
        </li>
        <li>
          It then processes this data to generate corresponding vocal responses
          through the speaker, using the DF Player Mini.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><h3>ASTA (Automated Students Tracking Application)</h3></li>
      <p>Nov 2022 - Nov 2022</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ASTA, the Sanskrit word which means reliable is a Student Security
          System based on the RFID principle.
        </li>
        <li>
          It focuses on foolproof surveillance of students inside the school
          premises.
        </li>
        <li>
          The main motive behind this project is to create a parental-friendly
          environment for students which provides safety to them from any kind
          of nuisance activities and a secured journey from their respective
          houses to school.
        </li>
        <li>
          This setup gathers analog data through the MPU6050 module, which is
          transmitted to the Arduino Uno.
        </li>
        <li>
          We’ve used an ARDUINO UNO microcontroller board which acts as the
          motherboard here and a RFID RC522 Reader/Writer module that reads the
          UID (Unique Identification Number) of the students’, present in the
          ID-Card which will transmit the UID to the processor of the
          microcontroller board through radio waves and thereby through the
          signals of the microcontroller board the SIM 900A GSM Module will send
          a notification to the parent's mobile phone.
